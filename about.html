<p class="subtext">We believe that <a href="https://pacharanero.github.io/opensourceistheonlyway/#/">open source is the only way for medicine.</a></p>
<p class="subtext">We understand that the NHS differs from other enterprises.</p>
<p class="subtext">We know that the NHS delivers healthcare in an unique way.</p>
<p class="subtext">We make software to fit the NHS, not expecting the NHS to fit the software.</p>
<p class="subtext">We recognise that the practice of medicine improves by sharing information and learning.</p>
<p class="subtext">We think that same practice should include the digital tools used to deliver medical care.</p>
